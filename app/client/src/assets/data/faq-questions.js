    question: "What is a hackathon?",
    answer:
      "We at HackUCI like to believe that a hack-a-thon is very much like an invent-a-thon where like-minded individuals with various different backgrounds and skill sets come together for 36 hours to “invent” something from the ground up. The only thing limiting what you build is your own creativity — we’ll provide the rest."
  },
  {
    question: "Who can come?",
    answer: "Any undergraduate or graduate students over the age of 18."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I create?",
    answer:
      "You can build whatever you can dream of, whether that be a website with an amazing feature, a phone app, or a rad piece of hardware! Our only rule is that all code must be written during the hackathon itself. Feel free to use open source libraries and APIs; companies attending may provide their own as well. Impress us!"

    question: "Are there sponsors and prizes?",

  },
  {
    question:
      "What if I have no prior experience in programming, coding, or hackathons?",
    answer:
      "We don’t expect hackers to have any prior experience. We will be providing starter packs and workshops to help new hackers get started on projects and learn new technologies."
  },
  {
    question:
      "Am I allowed to come with a project pre-built or will I be building the project from scratch?",
    answer:
      "You will be building projects from scratch, although we will be offering starter packs to help you get started if you are a beginner hacker. You are encouraged to come with ideas of what you want to build."

    question: "I have another question!",

  },
  {
    question: "What platform will you be using to host HackUCI?",
    answer:
      "Currently, we are testing out several different platforms for HackUCI 2021.  HackUCI will be using Slack as our way of the main-source of communication for the event. Expect announcements, mentor support, and memes to be discussed here! However, as far as other platforms, Zoom is our main contender to make events, workshops, and team collaborations easier with separate channels or rooms to join! We are also exploring other options including YouTube or Twitch to host our opening and closing ceremonies."
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do you plan to keep the sense of community in an online event?",
    answer:
      "As mentioned before, with the following online platforms, we are going to leverage our virtual event's tooling to facilitate networking with hackers, mentors, and sponsors! Additionally, we are looking to keep the spirit of the hackathon alive via numerous virtual-friendly events and workshops."
